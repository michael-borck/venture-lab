### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `ai_providers.rs` and `ai_providers.test.rs` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` to run frontend tests and `cargo test` to run Rust backend tests.
- Tauri commands need to be registered in `main.rs` and exposed to the frontend via `tauri_frontend_api.js`.
