# Prompt Engineering Guide

Master the art of writing effective prompts to get better results from AI.

## 🎯 Prompt Engineering Basics

### What is a Prompt?

A prompt is the instruction or question you give to an AI model. Better prompts = better results.

### The Golden Rules

1. **Be Specific** - Vague prompts get vague answers
2. **Provide Context** - Help the AI understand your situation
3. **Set Clear Expectations** - Tell the AI what you want
4. **Iterate and Refine** - Improve based on results

## 📝 Prompt Components

### 1. Role/Persona
Tell the AI who to be:
```
"Act as a experienced startup mentor..."
"You are a market research analyst..."
"As a venture capitalist..."
```

### 2. Task/Instruction
Clear action to perform:
```
"Generate 5 innovative business ideas..."
"Analyze the market opportunity for..."
"Evaluate this pitch and provide feedback..."
```

### 3. Context/Background
Relevant information:
```
"...in the sustainable technology sector"
"...for millennials in urban areas"
"...with a budget under $10,000"
```

### 4. Format/Output
How to structure the response:
```
"Present as a bulleted list"
"Use a professional tone"
"Keep each point under 50 words"
```

### 5. Examples (Optional)
Show what you want:
```
"Similar to Uber for X model"
"Format: [Problem] → [Solution] → [Impact]"
```

```

### 4. Iteration Prompts
Build on previous outputs:
