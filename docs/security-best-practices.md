# Security Best Practices

This guide covers security best practices for using VentureLab safely and protecting your API keys.

## üîê API Key Security

### How VentureLab Stores Your Keys

VentureLab uses your operating system's secure credential storage:

- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
- **macOS**: macOS Keychain
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring/KWallet)

Your API keys are **never** stored in plain text files or application settings.

### Best Practices for API Keys

1. **Never Share Your API Keys**
   - Treat API keys like passwords
   - Don't commit them to version control
   - Don't share them in emails or messages

2. **Use Separate Keys for Different Projects**
   - Create project-specific API keys when possible
   - Makes it easier to track usage and costs
   - Allows revoking access without affecting other projects

3. **Regularly Rotate Your Keys**
   - Change API keys periodically
   - Immediately rotate if you suspect compromise
   - Delete old keys from provider dashboards

4. **Monitor Key Usage**
   - Use VentureLab's Usage Statistics feature
   - Check provider dashboards regularly
   - Set up billing alerts

## üõ°Ô∏è Environment Security

### Secure Your Development Environment

1. **Keep Your System Updated**
   - Install OS security updates
   - Update VentureLab regularly
   - Keep antivirus software current

2. **Use Strong System Passwords**
   - Protects access to stored credentials
   - Use biometric authentication when available
   - Enable system lock screens

3. **Be Careful with Screen Sharing**
   - Hide API keys during demos
   - Close VentureLab during screen shares
   - Use the password toggle feature

### Network Security

1. **Use Secure Networks**
   - Avoid public WiFi for sensitive work
   - Use VPN when necessary
   - Ensure HTTPS connections

2. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Allow VentureLab through firewall
   - Block unnecessary incoming connections
   - Monitor outgoing connections

## üö® If Your Keys Are Compromised

### Immediate Actions

1. **Revoke the Compromised Key**
   - Go to your AI provider's dashboard
   - Revoke or delete the key immediately
   - Generate a new key

2. **Update VentureLab**
   - Delete the old key in AI Providers settings
   - Add the new key
   - Test the connection

3. **Check for Unauthorized Usage**
   - Review recent API usage
   - Check billing statements
   - Contact provider support if needed

### Prevention

- Enable 2FA on AI provider accounts
- Use IP allowlists when available
- Set spending limits on accounts

## üîí Data Privacy

### What VentureLab Stores Locally
