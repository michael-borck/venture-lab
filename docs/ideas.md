## **🎯 Recommended: Single Unified App**

### **Why One App is Better for Education:**

**🎓 Pedagogical Benefits:**
- **Learning Journey**: Students progress from Idea → Analysis → Pitch → Documentation 
- **Cross-Tool Integration**: Ideas from Idea Forge can flow into Global Compass analysis
- **Unified Settings**: One place to configure AI providers (especially important for classroom setup)
- **Data Persistence**: Ideas, analyses, and pitches can reference each other

**👩‍🏫 Instructor Benefits:**
- **Single Installation**: One app for students to download and install
- **Unified Support**: One codebase to maintain and update
- **Progress Tracking**: Can see student work across all tools in one place
- **Consistent UX**: Students learn one interface, not four different apps

**🔄 Workflow Integration:**
```
Idea Forge → Generate business concept
     ↓
Global Compass → Analyze market opportunity  
     ↓
Pitch Perfect → Refine presentation
     ↓
PRD Generator → Create technical specifications
```

### **Architecture Approach:**
```
Entrepreneurship AI Tools/
├── Dashboard (main hub)
├── Idea Forge (tool 1)
├── Global Compass (tool 2) 
├── Pitch Perfect (tool 3)
├── PRD Generator (tool 4)
└── Settings (shared)
```

## **📱 App Structure I Recommend:**

### **Main Dashboard** 
- Overview of all tools
- Recent projects/files
- Quick access to settings
- Progress tracking

### **Tool Pages**
- Each tool gets its own full page/route
- Shared navigation between tools
- Ability to "pass data" between tools
- Consistent save/export functionality

### **Shared Infrastructure**
- Single settings configuration
- Unified file management
- Common AI provider handling
- Consistent styling/branding

## **🔧 Implementation Benefits:**

**Single Tauri App:**
- Shared Rust backend code
- One build process
- Smaller total file size
- Better performance (shared resources)

**Component Reuse:**
- Shared UI components
- Common prompt generation utilities
- Unified error handling
- Consistent loading states

## **🎯 Alternative Consideration:**

**The only reason to split into separate apps** would be if:
- Different tools need very different AI models
- Licensing requirements differ per tool
- Students only need access to specific tools
- Technical constraints require separation

But for education, these rarely apply.

## **📋 Recommended Project Structure:**

```bash
src/
├── components/
│   ├── shared/           # Shared components
│   ├── IdeaForge/        # Tool-specific components
│   ├── GlobalCompass/
│   ├── PitchPerfect/
│   └── PRDGenerator/
├── pages/
│   ├── Dashboard.jsx
│   ├── IdeaForge.jsx
│   ├── GlobalCompass.jsx
│   ├── PitchPerfect.jsx
│   └── PRDGenerator.jsx
├── lib/
│   ├── api.js           # Tauri integration
│   ├── prompts.js       # AI prompt utilities
│   └── utils.js         # Shared utilities
└── App.jsx              # Main routing
```

## **💡 Bottom Line:**

**Stick with the unified app approach!** It's perfect for education and gives you the best user experience. Your current Tauri setup is already structured correctly for this.

When you move to Claude Code, you can say:

> "Help me build out the full dashboard with navigation between the four AI tools, keeping them all in one unified Tauri app"

This approach will give students the best learning experience and you the easiest maintenance! 🚀
